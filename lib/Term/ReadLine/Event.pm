# ABSTRACT: Wrappers for Term::ReadLine's new event_loop model.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AnyEvent;
    use Term::ReadLine::Event;

    my $term = Term::ReadLine::Event->with_AnyEvent('...');

    my $input = $term->readline('Prompt >');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides many of the event loop interactions shown in the examples
provided as a small change to your code rather than the longer code
required.

This may actually be sufficient for your use, or it may not.  This likely
depends on the loop being used.

=head1 HISTORY

This project started with a goal: to get L<Term::ReadLine> working under
L<Coro>.  Since L<Coro> used L<AnyEvent>, I thought that getting
L<Term::ReadLine> to use AnyEvent instead of Tk directly would be a win.
Conversations ensued, and it sounded like P5P generally liked the idea, but
didn't want anything AnyEvent-specific when it could be more generic than
that.

Through a couple of iterations, the event_loop interface was born.  However,
since this was no longer as simple as the old Tk interface (C<$term-E<gt>tkRunning(1)>),
I thought it would need some examples.  Putting examples into the perl core
seemed a bit strange, partly due to the extra overhead involved in updating
them, so having a distribution on CPAN full of examples seemed to make sense.
When looking for information on a module, my first place to look is CPAN,
so that made sense to me.

I then got some examples from other event loop developers (Paul "LeoNerd"
Evans and Rocco Caputo), and added them to my AnyEvent and Coro examples,
and that was the first release.  If others submit further examples, I will
add them and maybe this will grow.  Even if it doesn't, as long as it helps
people integrate Term::ReadLine into their event-loop-based apps, whether that's
Reflex or POE or AnyEvent or Coro or even using select loops to just do some
background processing, then it will have met its goal.

Having compiled a list of examples, I then realised that most of the examples
could be abstracted into a module.  Again, directly into Term::ReadLine
would be too specific for P5P, but just perfect for a distribution.  If you
choose to install this distribution instead of just swiping the example that
suits you, you can integrate with an event loop in a single line (for L<POE>,
that's significant savings, for L<Coro>, not so much).

Note that the examples are more complete than the test files as well. This is
largely because testing full readline functionality in an automated fashion is
not entirely trivial.  The hope would be that anyone making changes to
Term::ReadLine in the future be able to use these examples in their own
testing to ensure they don't break anything.  (If you do, be sure you're
testing with L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> and L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>, testing
with just L<Term::ReadLine::Stub> will miss things.)

Hopefully, this makes it trivial enough to use event loops with T::RL
such that anyone can do it.  You can get back to focusing on your
business logic instead of arcane rituals to get event loops integrated
with Term::ReadLine.  And hopefully that means we get more perl apps
that have nice interfaces (with readline support), even when doing
other things in the background (events).

It is not my intention to provide wrappers for all event loops.  It is
my intention only to provide examples for as many loops as possible. 
The wrappers are intended to be examples as well (though covered under
Artistic/GPL licensing whereas the examples themselves are more
permissive), and not necessarily used as-is, partially due to their
size (all the wrappers are in a single module).  That being said, I
would likely just use the wrapper because I'm too lazy to copy the
examples into my code.  If I were entirely concerned about RAM usage,
I'd be writing in C.

=head1 METHODS

All constructors (C<with_>*) take as their first parameter one of:

=over 4

=item *

The name of the application, which gets passed in to Term::ReadLine's
constructor.

    my $term = Term::ReadLine::Event->with_Foo('myapp');

=item *

An array ref consisting of the name of the application, and the input
and output filehandles.  This is useful if you need to override
these filehandles.

    my $term = Term::ReadLine::Event->with_Foo(['myapp', \*STDIN, \*STDOUT]);

=item *

A pre-constructed Term::ReadLine object.  This is useful if you need
to do other things with the Term::ReadLine object prior to setting up
the event loop, or if you have a custom package derived from Term::ReadLine
and you do not want Term::ReadLine::Event to create the default type.

    my $term = Term::ReadLine::Special->new('myapp', other => 'stuff');
    $term = Term::ReadLine::Event->with_Foo($term);

=back

Parameters for setting up the event loop, if any are required, will be
after this first parameter as named parameters, e.g.:

   Term::ReadLine::Event->with_IO_Async('myapp', loop => $loop);

All constructors also assume that the required module(s) is(are) already
loaded.  That is, if you're using with_AnyEvent, you have already loaded
AnyEvent (and thus the event loop it is using); if you're using with_POE,
you have already loaded POE, etc.

=head2 DESTROY

During destruction, we attempt to clean up.  Note that L<Term::ReadLine>
does not like to have a second T::RL object created in the same process.
This means that you should only ever let the object returned by the
constructors to go out of scope when you will I<never use Term::ReadLine
again in that process>.

This largely makes destruction moot, but it can be nice in some scenarios
to clean up after oneself.

=cut

    };
}

=head2 trl

Access to the Term::ReadLine object itself.  Since Term::ReadLine::Event
is not a Term::ReadLine, but HAS a Term::ReadLine, this gives access to
the underlying object in case something isn't exposed sufficiently.  This
should not be an issue since T::RL::E automatically maps any call it doesn't
recognise directly on to the underlying T::RL.
